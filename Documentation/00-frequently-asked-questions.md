## Overview

This page answers frequently asked questions about Hytale modding, server architecture, and technical capabilities.

---

## Client & Server Architecture

### 1. Can the client be modded?

**No**, the client cannot be modded directly.

**However:**

* The server controls how the game and UI looks
* Works similar to "Resource Packs" in Minecraft
* The server decides what mods are used
* Visuals are server-side controlled
* No client-side mods needed for security and consistency

**Benefits of Server-Side Modding:**

* Join any modded server without downloading external mods
* One stable client for all players
* Better security (no client modifications)
* Unified community experience
* Server owners control the experience

**Philosophy:**

> *"One Community, One Client"* - Hytale avoids the fragmented ecosystem of different modded clients by keeping all modifications server-side.

## Network & Technical

### 2. What Network Protocol will be used?

**Hytale uses the QUIC transport protocol.**

### Understanding Internet Protocols:

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**

* Connectionless and fast
* Fire-and-forget packets
* Less reliability (packets can be lost)

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**

* Connection-based
* Slower than UDP
* Guaranteed packet delivery
* Much more reliability

**QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections):**

* **Hybrid protocol** building on UDP
* Same speed benefits as UDP
* Adds reliability layers like TCP
* **Excellent for game development**
* Blends speed and reliability

**Why QUIC?**

* Best of both worlds for multiplayer gaming
* Modern, efficient protocol
* Designed for low-latency applications
* Industry-proven (used by Google, YouTube, etc.)

## Server Infrastructure

### 3. What are Transfer Packets?

**Transfer packets** are small data payloads (4KB) that allow players to move from one server to another while carrying information.

### Key Points:

**What They Are:**

* Small data containers (4KB limit)
* Carry player information between servers
* Enable seamless server transitions
* Preserve inventory, stats, and progress

**What They Are NOT:**

* **Not equivalent to BungeeCord or Velocity**
* Do not manage network-wide features
* Do not support global plugins
* DDOS protection would be very difficult for small networks

### Best Use Cases:

**Perfect For:**

* Small server networks
* Hub-based setups
* Server-to-server player transfers
* Preserving player state across servers

**Example Scenario:**

```
Player finishes dungeon on Server A
  ↓
Transfer packet created with inventory + stats
  ↓
Player moves to Server B (lobby)
  ↓
Inventory and stats intact

```

### Benefits:

* **Lower Server Costs** - Distribute players across multiple servers
* **Better Performance** - Dedicated servers for specific game modes
* **Development Focus** - Less time on network infrastructure, more on gameplay
* **Seamless Experience** - Players don't lose progress when switching servers

### Limitations:

* Primarily intended for **smaller servers**
* Not a full proxy solution like BungeeCord
* 4KB data limit per transfer
* Network-wide features require custom implementation

### 4. Will Hytale support dedicated servers?

**Yes!** Hytale will fully support dedicated servers.

### What This Means:

**Hosting Options:**

* Host on your own hardware
* Use third-party hosting services
* Full control over server settings
* Install and configure mods
* Optimize performance

### Benefits of Dedicated Servers:

**Complete Control:**

* Server settings and configurations
* Mod installation and management
* Performance tuning and optimization
* Backup and maintenance schedules

**Flexibility:**

* Choose your hosting provider
* Scale resources as needed
* Run custom plugins and packs
* Full administrative access

**Professional Options:**

* Enterprise-grade hosting
* Custom hardware configurations
* Advanced networking setups
* Professional support options

### Hosting Methods:

1. **Self-Hosted** - Run on your own hardware
2. **VPS/Cloud** - Rent virtual private servers (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)
3. **Game Hosting** - Specialized game server hosts
4. **Hybrid** - Mix of self-hosted and cloud resources

## Platform Support

### 5. Will Hytale support modding on consoles?

**As of now, Hytale modding is primarily focused on PC platforms.**

### Current Status:

**PC Platforms:**

* Windows
* macOS
* Linux

**Console Support:**

* Not confirmed for modding
* Game may come to consoles in the future
* Modding tools designed for PC

### Why PC-First?

**Technical Reasons:**

* Modding requires file system access
* Console platforms have restrictions
* Development tools are PC-based
* Testing and iteration easier on PC

**Platform Limitations:**

* Console manufacturers restrict modifications
* Certification processes are complex
* Updates and patches have approval delays
* File access is limited or prohibited

### Future Possibilities:

While current modding support is PC-focused, the team hasn't ruled out future console support for:

* Playing on modded servers (server-side mods)
* Official mod marketplace
* Curated content packs
